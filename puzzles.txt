the best of both worlds
spill the beans
time is money
you reap what you sow
pull someone's leg
easy come easy go
down to the wire
fortune favors the bold
no pain no gain
lose your touch
throw caution to the wind
practice makes perfect
a watched pot never boils
cost an arm and a leg
get a second wind
no news is good news
beat around the bush
sleep on it
a blessing in disguise
hit the sack
leave no stone unturned
let bygones be bygones
it takes two to tango
rain on your parade
the more the merrier
rome wasn't built in a day
beggars can't be choosers
think outside the box
cut to the chase
throw in the towel
live and let live
go the extra mile
speak of the devil
put your foot down
love is blind
get out of hand
under your nose
know the ropes
let your hair down
the last straw
make ends meet
weather the storm
in hot water
go out on a limb
you can say that again
burn the midnight oil
no man is an island
don't rock the boat
jump on the bandwagon
bite the bullet
it is what it is
read between the lines
scratch the surface
piece of cake
out of sight out of mind
toe the line
bend over backwards
barking up the wrong tree
steal someone's thunder
wrap your head around it
walk on eggshells
there's no place like home
in the nick of time
turn over a new leaf
make a long story short
under the weather
look before you leap
sit on the fence
keep your chin up
better safe than sorry
on thin ice
ignorance is bliss
hit the nail on the head
curiosity killed the cat
stick your neck out
play it by ear
off the beaten path
once in a blue moon
all bark and no bite
let sleeping dogs lie
jump the gun
call it a day
up in the air
take a rain check
let the cat out of the bag
ants in your pants
to each their own
no ifs ands or buts
after the fact
safe and sound
neck and neck
this too shall pass
heart of gold
the plot thickens
the early bird
for the record
back to the drawing board
your guess is as good as mine
burst your bubble
clear as day
do the right thing
feast or famine
the elephant in the room
kick the bucket
strike while the iron is hot
grease the wheels
between a rock and a hard place
take it with a grain of salt
shoot for the moon
in the same boat
hard pill to swallow
when the dust settles
talk is cheap
the big picture
level the playing field
needle in a haystack
give or take
beauty is only skin deep
worth its weight in gold
by and large
music to my ears
with flying colors
money does not grow on trees
make the cut
reinvent the wheel
put your best foot forward
few and far between
reach for the stars
under control
raise the bar
stop and smell the roses
for crying out loud
hit the ground running
burning the midnight oil
open a can of worms
beyond the pale
have bigger fish to fry
if the shoe fits
its not rocket science
more than meets the eye
day in and day out
bring down the house
never say never
tip of the iceberg
wild goose chase
around the clock
from the bottom of my heart
circle the wagons
beware the ides of march
little did i know
follow your heart
get your act together
throw your hat into the ring
face the music
meet in the middle
pick up the pieces
patience is a virtue
fly off the handle
put all your eggs in one basket
water under the bridge
under pressure
close but no cigar
at the drop of a hat
count your blessings
change of heart
do not rock the boat
on cloud nine
mind over matter
show your true colors
dressed to the nines
third times the charm
let the chips fall where they may
give the green light
diamond in the rough
in the blink of an eye
pull out all the stops
grass is always greener
slow and steady wins the race
calm before the storm
against the grain
walking on thin ice
on the fence
a dime a dozen
add fuel to the fire
the straw that broke the camels back
do unto others
keep it simple
low hanging fruit
pay it forward
still waters run deep
home is where the heart is
head over heels
stand your ground
saved by the bell
jump through hoops
crack of dawn
pain in the neck
jump through hoops
born with a silver spoon
rule of thumb
spring to mind
come rain or shine
as good as gold
sick and tired
the icing on the cake
all in a days work
caught red handed
pull yourself together
odds and ends
part and parcel
silver lining
ahead of the curve
no time like the present
cold hard cash
step up to the plate
fish out of water
open secret
every now and then
take the plunge
from the ground up
the ball is in your court
fly by night
do not sweat it
rise and shine
devil is in the details
not out of the woods
break the ice
take the cake
straight and narrow
hang in there
dead as a doornail
short and sweet
does not hold water
in a nutshell
take the wheel
do not shoot the messenger
right as rain
sink or swim
against all odds
light at the end of the tunnel
early bird gets the worm
par for the course
rise and fall
touch and go
above and beyond
down for the count
green with envy
cool as a cucumber
all in good time
make no bones about it
honesty is the best policy
have a change of heart
you win some you lose some
trial by fire
hold your horses
all systems go
back to basics
between a rock and a hard place
when push comes to shove
over the moon
better late than never
stuff of legends
get cold feet
word to the wise
pass the buck
tooth and nail
under one roof
fit as a fiddle
easier said than done
like father like son
down to the last detail
the ball is in your court
turn the tables
work like a dog
take the high road
fall through the cracks
dog eat dog world
hit the ground running
when push comes to shove
fair and square
skeletons in the closet
peace of mind
under the radar
well oiled machine
out of left field
cry over spilled milk
spill your guts
down to earth
actions speak louder
drop of a hat
save for a rainy day
out of the blue
hit the road jack
last but not least
keep an eye out
move the goalposts
high and dry
under the sun
give me a break
more or less
close to home
no strings attached
give and take
bite the hand that feeds you
walk a mile in my shoes
full of hot air
sitting on pins and needles
back to square one
if it aint broke do not fix it
the sky is the limit
kill two birds with one stone
